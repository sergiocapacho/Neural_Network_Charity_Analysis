# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

With machine learning and neural networks this project goal is to help Beks creating a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing
### Target(s) for your model 
The variable "is successful" is the target of this model
### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Ein, name, application_type, affiliation, classification, use_case, organization, income_amt, and special_considerations 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model



### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
